      <h1>PRESS RELEASE</h1>
      <p class="intro">Newcastle tech startup Krellian to provide interactive digital signage, built on web standards.</p>
      <p><strong>Newcastle Upon Tyne, UK, 12th March 2020</strong> - A new technology startup in Newcastle will provide a content delivery platform for interactive kiosks and digital signage, built on cutting-edge web technologies. <a href="https://krellian.com">Krellian</a>’s offering will include a simple and reliable web-based operating system for on-premise digital displays and a secure cloud service to monitor, control and deliver content to those displays over the internet.</p>

      <p>This innovative digital signage solution will power passive displays like digital billboards, departure boards and digital menus as well as interactive touch screens used in information kiosks, self-service kiosks and interactive exhibits. The technology has applications in a wide range of markets including retail, hospitality, healthcare, museums, advertising, travel, tourism and education.</p>

      <p>Founder Ben Francis has spent the last decade immersed in the Silicon Valley and Silicon Fen tech scenes and for the last eight years worked for the Mozilla Corporation on the Firefox OS mobile operating system and WebThings IoT platform. Ben has a Masters Degree in Interactive Computer Systems from the University of Birmingham and has previously worked at Google and various startups in Cambridge and the East Midlands.</p>

      <p><em>“I’d like to bring some of the tech know-how and entrepreneurial spirit from Silicon Valley to the North East of England, to help create new high-tech jobs in an area with a proud heritage of engineering excellence.”</em></p>

      <p>Krellian is currently in the early stages of development as part of the <a href="https://www.highpotentialstartups.co.uk/">High Potential Startups</a> programme, supported by the North East Local Enterprise Partnership and the North East Growth Hub.</p>
