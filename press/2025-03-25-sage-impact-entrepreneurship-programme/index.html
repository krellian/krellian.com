      <h1>PRESS RELEASE</h1>
      <p class="intro">Newcastle-based Climate Tech Startup selected for International Impact Accelerator</p>
      <p><strong>Newcastle Upon Tyne, UK - 25th March 2025</strong> - North East tech startup <a href="https://krellian.com/">Krellian</a> has been selected to participate in the <a href="https://vilcap.com/programs/sage-impact-entrepreneurship-europe">Sage Impact Entrepreneurship Programme</a> by <a href="https://vilcap.com">Village Capital</a> to help scale their smart building solution.</p>
      <p>Krellian helps facilities managers of commercial buildings to meet their net zero targets whilst saving money, by optimising space utilisation and reducing energy consumption using smart building technology.</p>
      <p><a href="https://krellian.com/hub/">Krellian Hub</a> is a first of its kind commercial smart building hub which consolidates multi-vendor building management systems into a single standardised interface using the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WoT/">Web of Things</a>. Data from the hub can then be streamed in real time to the <a href="https://krellian.com/cloud/">Krellian Cloud</a> service, which creates a digital twin of a building to model how it is being used and help identify potential optimisations.</p>
      <p>After validating their business idea through the <a href="https://www.ignite.io/">Ignite</a> Pre-accelerator, Krellian has built its smart building solution with the help of £75k in <a href="https://www.ukri.org/councils/innovate-uk/">Innovate UK</a> grants and a strategic partnership with <a href="https://canonical.com/">Canonical</a>.</p>
      <p>The fledgling startup has now been selected from over 200 applicants to join the first European cohort of the international <a href="https://vilcap.com/programs/sage-impact-entrepreneurship-europe">Sage Impact Entrepreneurship Programme</a>. Through this programme Krellian will receive tailored mentoring, support, training and a $10k milestone grant before going on to compete in a peer selected process for a further $50k in grant capital at the Program Summit in Atlanta, GA, US.</p>
      <p>The programme is a part of a three year initiative sponsored by the <a href="https://www.sage.com/en-gb/company/sage-foundation/">Sage Foundation</a> to support 165 entrepreneurs across the UK, France, Southern Europe and the US who are making a positive environmental, social, and economic impact.</p>
      <p>Krellian Founder <a href="https://tola.me.uk/">Ben Francis</a> says:</p>
      <blockquote>&quot;After eight years of working on mobile and smart home technology at Mozilla I became a dad, and decided I wanted to apply everything I’d learnt to helping solve the climate crisis. I founded Krellian to use smart building technology to make our built environment smarter, safer and more sustainable. We’ve already done a lot of hard work to validate that we’re solving a problem that people really care about, and build our first solution. This programme will help us get that product to market, plan for scale, and ready the business for further investment.&quot;</blockquote>
